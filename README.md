# VM Capacity Analysis
This is a spreadsheet created to perform basic VM capacity calculations and planning, without requiring expensive commercial products or tools only available to partners. This was developed during a new cluster design project, after about the 4th time I had to re-run my capacity numbers based on different scenarios.

The intent is to assist with analyzing your current capacity and provisioning levels, as well as determining specifications to meet a given capacity need. It also makes it easy to model different scenarios by turning on and off various new workloads/projects to see how different combinations will affect the numbers.

## Assess the Current State
Before projecting future needs, you must understand the current capacity and performance.

### Inventory and Performance Analysis
- Identify existing hardware: CPU, RAM, Storage, and Network.
- Assess current vSphere environment: ESXi hosts, clusters, datastores.
- Gather performance metrics: CPU utilization, memory usage, storage IOPS, latency, network throughput.
- Identify bottlenecks and areas of underutilization.

### Capacity Utilization Analysis
- Calculate current CPU, memory, and storage utilization.
- Measure VM density per ESXi host.
- Identify over-provisioned or underutilized VMs.
- Analyze historical trends (last 6-12 months) to establish usage patterns.

### Licensing and Cost Review
- Review vSphere licensing models (vSAN, vRealize, NSX).
- Assess operational and capital expenditures.

---

## Forecast Growth and Future Requirements
Project future resource demands based on business needs and growth plans.

### Business Growth Projections
- Gather input from stakeholders on upcoming projects, applications, and user growth.
- Align with business strategies (cloud migration, digital transformation, disaster recovery).

### Workload Growth Estimation
- Estimate new VM workloads (applications, databases, microservices).
- Project increases in CPU, memory, and storage consumption.
- Account for seasonal or event-driven workload spikes.

### Trend-Based Forecasting
- Use historical performance data to predict future usage.
- Apply linear or exponential growth models for 1, 3, and 5-year projections.
- Consider the impact of new technologies (AI, containerization, automation).

---

## Define Capacity Expansion Strategies
Based on the forecasts, develop strategies to meet future demands.

### Short-Term (1-Year) Plan
- Optimize existing resources (right-sizing VMs, workload balancing).
- Implement automation (DRS, vROps) to maximize efficiency.
- Upgrade hardware/software if needed (storage expansion, memory upgrades).

### Medium-Term (3-Year) Plan
- Plan for incremental hardware expansion (new ESXi hosts, NVMe storage).
- Evaluate hybrid cloud strategies (VMware Cloud on AWS, Azure VMware Solution).
- Consider software-defined storage (vSAN) or networking (NSX) for scalability.

### Long-Term (5-Year) Plan
- Plan for infrastructure modernization (hyperconverged, composable infrastructure).
- Transition to cloud-native applications (Kubernetes, Tanzu).
- Integrate AI/ML for predictive capacity management.
- Budget for full hardware refresh cycles.

## Implement Monitoring and Optimization
Ensure continuous monitoring and proactive capacity management.

### Implement Monitoring Tools
- VMware vRealize Operations (vROps) for performance analytics.
- vSphere Performance Charts, ESXTOP for real-time analysis.
- Third-party tools like Turbonomic, Runecast for deep insights.

### Automate Capacity Management
- Configure alerts for resource thresholds.
- Use vSphere DRS (Distributed Resource Scheduler) for dynamic resource allocation.
- Implement predictive analytics for capacity planning.

### Cost Optimization
- Identify and remove zombie VMs.
- Implement chargeback/showback models for better resource accountability.
- Optimize storage with deduplication and compression (vSAN).

## Report - Capacity

### Current resource utilization and bottlenecks.
- Identify overused or underutilized resources.
- Detect workload imbalances and inefficiencies.

### Growth forecasts for 1, 3, and 5 years.
- Provide data-driven projections for resource needs.
- Adjust based on business growth and technology trends.

### Recommendations for scaling infrastructure.
- Suggest infrastructure upgrades and optimizations.
- Define strategies for workload distribution and cost efficiency.

### Budget estimates and ROI analysis.
- Estimate costs for scaling and upgrades.
- Justify investments with projected returns.
